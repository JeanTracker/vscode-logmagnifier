filters: implement group renaming and item editing

Add context menu actions to rename filter groups and edit filter items,
providing an alternative to inline editing which is not natively
supported for TreeItems.

Changes:
- Add `logmagnifier.renameFilterGroup` for group renaming.
- Add `logmagnifier.editFilterItem` for editing filter properties.
- Implement 2-step editing (Name -> Pattern) for regex filters and
  direct keyword editing for word filters in `CommandManager`.
- Add `renameGroup` and `updateFilter` methods to `FilterManager`.
- Register commands and context menu items in `package.json`, employing
  the '...' convention for commands requiring user input.
